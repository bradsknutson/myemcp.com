========

myemcp.com is a Redirect tool, built specifically for the new digital resource center.  The tool works by appending an activity ID (as stored in the database for the resource center) to the end of myemcp.com.  The tool will then redirec the user to the activity.

Example: myemcp.com/1 will redirect the user to the URL specified for the resource center activity that matches ID 1 (in this case https://emc.bookshelf.emcp.com/file/book/QC1_WB_v1/#/page/r/101/act/fib.1).
